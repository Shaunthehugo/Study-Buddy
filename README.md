#Tutoring App

This app was created to help tutors and students connect with each other and allow for students to have time for extra-curricular activities.

**This was also used as my senior project, and help me learn what real app development is like.**

##Future Plans
These features will be implemented due to the recent shutdown of Parse

- [ ] ~~Remove Parse API~~
- [ ] ~~Start Moving to Firebase~~
- [ ] Create Parse Server
- [ ] Resubmit
